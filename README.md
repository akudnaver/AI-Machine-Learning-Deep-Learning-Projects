Hello All,

Hope you are enjoying learning different flavors of DataScience and Machine Learning Methodoligies.

Well its about time, i share my understand and and exploration on Neural Network, Deep Learning.

I will try my best to explain my code which will allow Beginner's and Advance level Coders to start applying the concepts in their projects.

**In this section we will try to implement NN and DL on various projects:**

a) Text Generation and Analysis. b) Amazon Sentiment Analysis to review the feedback and predict the Rating. c) Movie Genre Prediction across different Movie Scripts.

I will add more projects as we go , so stay tuned and Happy learning !!
