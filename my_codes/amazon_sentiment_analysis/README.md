Goal of this Project
====================

This dataset is basically a collection of different feedback across Amazon Branded products. Idea is to gain some insight on Customer Reviews across these product and look for any improvement across the products from reviews.

This dataset is consist of columns:
==================================

['reportdate', 'onlinestore', 'upc', 'retailerproductcode', 'brand',
'category', 'subcategory', 'productdescription', 'reviewdate', 'reviewrating', 'reviewtitle', 'reviewtext', 'iscompetitor', 'manufacturer', 'market', 'matchedkeywords', 'timeofpublication',

Inspiration
===========

Although am trying to acheive Sentimental Analysis from the reviews, but the scope is not limited here. The initial goal for me was to work with this dataset in order to understand ,as how well the products across Amazon are doing and how we can improve there sell, but this ideology can be used across any Industry depending on there Business.

1) One of the think am targetting next is to improve my LSTM vocabulary to make my model more intelligent across all the words to capture most of the context for analysing feedback.

2) Along with point one, I am also planning to create a model which can suggest the best solution to improve the sales.

3) The Analogies and expectations discussed here , can be leveraged in any field to improve there Business.
