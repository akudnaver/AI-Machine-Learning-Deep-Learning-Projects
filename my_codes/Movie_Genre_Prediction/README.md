Hello Learners, 

Today i would like to share a code which basically predicts the Probability of Genre across Movie Scripts. 

This is basically an example of Multiclassification problem ,and I have used our well known Logistics Regression Probability algorithm 
to meet our purpose of predicting the Probabilities of these Genres. 

While coding this Project , it really helped me understand the different between Multiclassification and Multi Label Classification Problem.

I am sure it will be worth your time exploring this code which covers every aspect of DataScience and Machine Learning Algorithm especially 
when you are working with the big text data . 


In my next code, i will be using the Deep Learning Neural Network to explore other stuffs i can do with the Script.


That's it for now folks, Keep Learning and don't stop sharing :)

Ciao Gracias !!!!!!!
