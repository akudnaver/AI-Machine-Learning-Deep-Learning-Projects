Hello All, 

Hope you are enjoying learning different flavors of DataScience and Machine Learning Methodoligies. 

Well its about time, i share my understand and and exploration on Neural Network, Deep Learning. 

I will try my best to explain my code which will allow Beginner and Advance level Coders to start applying the concepts in their projects. 

In this section we will try to implement NN and DL on various projects:
